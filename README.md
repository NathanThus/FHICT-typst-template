## Getting Started

To get started with this Typst document template, follow these steps:

1. **Check for the roboto font**: Check if you have the roboto font installed on your system. If you don't, you can download it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
2. **Clone or Download**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine, or download the ZIP archive. If you choose to manually download the individual files, you will only need the template file and the `assets` folder.
3. **Install Typst**: I recommend to use VSCode with the [Typst LSP Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nvarner.typst-lsp). You will also need a PDF viewer in VSCode if you want to view the document live.
4. **Import the template**: Import the template into your own typst document.
5. **Set the available options**: Set the available options in the template file to your liking.
6. **Start writing**: Start writing your document.
